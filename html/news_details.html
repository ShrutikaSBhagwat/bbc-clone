            <h3>I left my home in Rwanda, the country of my birth, 30 years ago at the age of 12 - fleeing with my family from the horrors of the 1994 genocide.</h3>
            <h3>Growing up in Kenya and Norway and then settling in London, I often wondered what it would be like to go back and see if and how the country and the people had healed.</h3>
            <h3>When offered the opportunity to travel there to make a documentary on that very topic, I was excited but also extremely anxious about what I would find - and how I would react.</h3>
            <h3>Warning: Some people may find details in this story distressing.
            </h3>
            <h3>I have lived with the emotional scars of these events in the form of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which can be triggered unexpectedly.</h3>
            <h3>Like many Rwandans, I lost many family members. In just 100 days, 800,000 people were killed by ethnic Hutu extremists targeting members of the minority Tutsi community, as well as their political opponents, irrespective of their ethnic origin.</h3>
            <h3>The mainly Tutsi forces who took power following the genocide were also alleged to have killed thousands of Hutu people in Rwanda in retaliation.</h3>
            <h3>Emotions were swirling within me when I landed in the capital, Kigali.
            </h3>
            <h3>The joy of hearing my language Kinyarwanda being spoken all around me. But also the recognition that the last time I was in the city, chaos reigned, with millions of us running for our lives, trying to stay alive.</h3>
